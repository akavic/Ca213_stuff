A class should only be concerend with one thing
in the switchable i could have easily cretea a method tun on and off which took a parameter of light or object to detrmine whether they should turn on and off
but that wrong cuase i'd have to create an on and off switch for every new device ...but with the intreface class switchable
i declare two methods on and off then in switchable then in switch i'm only concerend with classes that can call on an off(basically class that implement switchable )
